# London Bike Rides Analysis Using Tableau
## Project Overview
Welcome to the London Bike Rides Analysis project repository! This project is based on the analysis of bike ride data in London, which I conducted by following a YouTube tutorial by Mo Chen. In this guided project, I performed an analysis of bike ride data in London using Tableau. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, data sources, and how to access and use the Tableau visualization.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the bike rides from London and gain insights into moving average bike rides, bike usage patterns, popular ride weather, peak ride times, and more. By visualizing the data using Tableau, I aimed to make the findings more accessible and understandable for a wider audience.

## Data Sources
The data used for this analysis is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). It includes information about bike rides in London, including ride duration, start and end locations, ride dates, and more.

## Tableau Visualization
The main visualization is created using Tableau, which allows for interactive exploration of the bike ride data. The visualization provides insights into:

Total rides over time Moving vverage rides Temperature and wind speed Peak ride hours Popular ride weather
